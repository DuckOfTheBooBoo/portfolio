Get to know me

#intro
I am an undergraduate Information Technology student at CEP-CCIT, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia. I am passionate about learning software development, with a particular interest in back-end development. However, I am also open to working as a full-stack developer, as I enjoy understanding both sides of the development process.
